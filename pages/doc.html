    <h1>Dartmouth Outing Club Registration Site</h1>

      <p>I worked as a designer for this project as part of Dartmouth's Digital Applied Learning and Innovation (DALI) Lab, an organization of student designers and developers who freelance on technology projects for partner organizations. For this project, my team worked with the Dartmouth Outing Club (DOC) to build a website for members to use to sign up for and organize weekend outings like hikes or kayaking trips. These are some screens from our final design:</p>

      <div class="column">
        <img src="../src/doc/4.png">
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <img src="../src/doc/1.png">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="desblurb">
      <p>We went through an intensive user-research and prototyping process as we worked towards this design, and we met with members of the DOC weekly to check that our designs were meeting their expectations. I took the lead on the trip dashboard and profile pages, so that's what I will highlight here. These are some of my first wireframes:</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <img src="../src/doc/3.png">
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <img src="../src/doc/5.png">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="desblurb">
      <p>One thing I struggled with in this design was whether to have the sign-up page be part of the trip description modal or to open in another page. After taking different opinions from user-testing into account, I decided it worked best as part of the modal so users can see what sign-up entails without navigating away from the available trip. Here are my cleaner low-fi prototypes:</p>

      <div class="column">
        <img src="../src/doc/6.png">
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <img src="../src/doc/7.png">
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <img src="../src/doc/8.png">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="desblurb">
      <p>The final stages of the project invovled fine-tuning the design with DOC branding and adding joy with the fun navigation bar and  club logos on the background of the trip cards. Since this project had to take many different types of users into account (trip leaders, non-members signing up for trips, and DOC staff) it had a lot of moving parts to bring together, and I enjoyed working on the dashboard that linked all types of users together.</p>
