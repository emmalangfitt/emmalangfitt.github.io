      <p>I worked on this project in a team of five as part of a Full-Stack Web Development class and had the most fun making a 90s-inspired interface for our app. My team wanted to develop a location-based collaborative playlist app with React Native using Spotify's Web API, and the rest of the team didn't have much design experience so I volunteered to take charge of the interface as well as contributing to the app's development.</p>

      <p>We were only given two weeks to complete this project, so I went through a rapid prototyping phase before settling on the final deisgn. I struggled most with the layout of the home page, since the varibale number of playlists could make the screen be empty or overflowing and I wanted the design to accomodate all edge cases nicely. Here are a few of the initial grayscales I made as I brainstormed homepage layouts:</p>

      <p>I usually am restricted by client preferences for design projects, so this was the first time I could implement absolutely anything I thought of and I just wanted to make the interface as colorful and loud and fun as I could. I took 90s music festival posters as inspiration and ran with it in designing a logo, then used the logo to guide the rest of the app. These are a few more screens from the final design:</p>
